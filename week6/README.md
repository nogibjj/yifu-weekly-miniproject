# Text-Based Game in Rust

This is a simple text-based game written in Rust. The game is a turn-based combat game where the player fights against an enemy. The outcome of each action is determined randomly using Rust's built-in rand crate.

## How to play

To play the game, you will need to have Rust installed on your computer. You can download Rust from the official website: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>

Once Rust is installed, you can run the game using the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

The game will then start and prompt you for input. You can choose to attack the enemy, rest to recover health, or quit the game. The outcome of each action is determined randomly.
